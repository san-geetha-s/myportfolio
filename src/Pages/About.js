              <p>
              I am a self-taught programmer and future MERN developer, getting trained by Brototype. A graduation in Botany could't stop me from entering into the field I am passionate about.

I am an aspiring programmer eagerly looking forward to do more projects thereby I could mark my contribution and sharpen my technical skills. I am currently working on Reactjs and Express on the front end , Nodejs and Mongodb on the backend.
